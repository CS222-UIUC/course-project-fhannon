# DESKTOP DESTRUCTION RAH RAH

## dev set-up

1. In desired folder, clone the git repository

> git clone -b collin\ https://github.com/CS222-UIUC/course-project-fhannon

2. In Finder, where you cloned your repository, rename the folder FHANNON to anything. We will only need the assets folder

3. In Unity, create a new project (2D Core) titled FHANNON in the new repository

4. Back in Finder, delete FHANNON/Assets. Move the other assets folder into FHANNON

5. Open the Unity Project. In the Assets/Scenes/ folder, select MAIN. You will be given the most recent version of the game

It's annoying and we're jumping through hoops. If someone is able to find a better solution that would be rad.
